        <p>Welcome to the Dragon Realms! The Dragons that exist here are peaceful but they guard their crystal treasure carefully. You can go home with some treasure but you'll have to beat the Dragons' Crystal Collector game.
        </p>
        <p>The rules are simple: Each of the four crystals has a value. All you have to do to win is collect enough crystals to match the value the dragons give you. If you go over, you lose. But the Dragon Realms' economy has been volitile recently due to crystal ore speculation. So the value of each colored crystal will most certainly change every time you finish a game. But the dragons have agreed to tell you the value of all the gems you have for each game. Click on a crystal to add it to your pile.
        </p>
        <p><em>Are you smart enough to win the dragons' treasure?</em></p>
